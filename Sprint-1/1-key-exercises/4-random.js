const minimum = 1;
const maximum = 100;

const num = Math.floor(Math.random() * (maximum - minimum + 1)) + minimum;

// In this exercise, you will need to work out what num represents?
// Try breaking down the expression and using documentation to explain what it means
// It will help to think about the order in which expressions are evaluated
// Try logging the value of num and running the program several times to build an idea of what the program is doing
console.log(num);
// Output: A random number between 1 and 100 (inclusive both 1 and 100)
//num is a random number generated between the minimum 1 and maximum values 100.
// The expression Math.random() generates a random floating-point number between [0,1).
// The expression (maximum - minimum + 1) calculates the range of numbers we want to generate, which is 100 - 1 + 1 = 100.
// The expression Math.floor() rounds down the result to the nearest whole number.
// Finally, we add the minimum value to ensure that the random number falls within the desired range.
